<P><font size="4"><b>Purpose</b></font><br>
The Field Service module provides the functions required to administer and execute the activities required for a field serive organization.  These include  service order creation, monitoring and posting, preventive maintenance tracking and scheduling, warranty tracking, inventory management, time and materials tracking, invoicing, and chargeback processing.</P>
<P><font size="4"><b>Prerequisites</b></font><br>
The Engineering and Inventory modules must be installed before using this module if inventory items are to be referenced on service orders, otherwise it may be run as a stand alone module.</P>
<P><font size="4"><b>Data Files</b></font><br>
There are seven data files which maintain the data directly associated with the module.<br><br>The Field Service Order file (FSO) maintains one record for each service call in the system.	The records are optionally keyed by a user assigned service order number, or a sequential number will be automatically assigned if desired. The Field Service Order file contains a general page which maintains information about the customer and the product being serviced., a work performed page for defining the tasks performed and their associated charges, a part used page which identifies the parts used during the service and their associated charges, and a revenue summary page which summarizes the charges, costs and profit or loss for the order.<br><br>The Serial file (SERIAL) maintains a history and status of each product for which service has or could be performed.  It also maintains warranty information and preventive maintenance schedules.<br><br>The Customer file (CUST) maintains one record for each customer used in the field service process.  The records are optionally keyed by a user defined  number or automatically assigned a sequential number if desired.	Along  with the standard customer information such as address, phone, contact,	etc., the customer file maintains data which can be defaulted into the	sales order process such as terms code, discount percents and sales rep  data.<br><br>The Price file (PRICE) maintains records which allow the user to control default pricing during the field service order process.	The file can be keyed by part number, which allow up to two (2) prices to be maintained per part, based upon effectivity dates.  Optionally, the user can assign a key made up of a combination of the part number and a customer code. This allows the maintenance of customer specific pricing.<br><br>The Terms (TERMS) file contains the records which define the terms of payment which may be included on the sales order.  These records are keyed by a user defined code and contain the parameters which define the terms.<br><br>The Sales History file (SALES) is keyed by a sequential number and maintains long term summarized sales information for reporting purposes. The records are created by the system when service orders are posted.<br><br>The Commission file (COMMISSION) is keyed by a sequential number and maintains the calculated sales commission amounts based on items sold on the service order. The records are created by the system when service orders are posted.</P>
<P><font size="4"><b>System Interface</b></font><br>
This module contains interfaces to the Engineering, General Ledger, Inventory and Accounts Receivable modules.  It validates part numbers with the Parts Master file in the Engineering module, and validates account numbers in the General Ledger chart of accounts.  Service order processing creates inventory transactions and the Invoicing process will create Accounts Receivable invoices. </P>
<P><font size="4"><b>User Interface</b></font><br>
The user interface to the module consists of data entry procedures to enter field service orders and maintain the serial number master file, reports and inquiries, and batch update procedures.  Access to these procedures is controlled by the user's security profile.  For example, some users may be allowed to enter new service orders while others may only be allowed to make changes to existing records.  Some users may only be allowed to look at the data without the ability to change it, and some may not even be able to access the procedure.  Access to batch procedures is usually restricted to use by only the system administrator since these are usually run overnight.</P>
<P><font size="4"><b>Setup Procedures</b></font><br>
The following are required setup procedures which must be performed prior to the normal flow of activities:<br><br><a href="TERMS-E.htm">TERMS.E</a><br>Definition of the payment terms for customers.<br><br><a href="CUST-E.htm">CUST.E</a><br>Identification of customers.<br><br><a href="FS-CONTROL.htm">FS.CONTROL</a><br>Definition of control information used in the module.<br><br><a href="REP-E.htm">REP.E</a><br>Identification of sales representatives.<br><br><a href="PRICE-E.htm">PRICE.E</a><br>Entry of product prices.<br><br><a href="STAX-E.htm">STAX.E</a><br>Sale tax code entry.</P>
<P><font size="4"><b>Flow of Activities</b></font><br>
The flow of processing for the field service module begins with the entry of the service order in the <a href="FSO-E.htm">FSO.E</a> procedure.  This may occur before the the service call is made based on a call from a customer needing service or a scheduled preventive maintenance.  In these cases basic information about the customer and the item to be serviced are entered and a service order form may be printed.  This step may be skipped if desired.  After the service is performed information regarding the labor expended and the materials consumed are entered into the order.  When all the information has been entered the order may be placed in a completed status.  Inventory is depleted at this time.<br><br>Once the service order has been closed, the <a href="FSO-P1.htm">FSO.P1</a> procedure will post the information, updating the sales history file (SALES), the commission file (COMM) and, when active will update the accounts receivable module with the amounts due.  Accounts payable deits will be created for chargebacks as well.<br><br>The maintenance of the Customer file (<a href="CUST-E.htm">CUST.E</a>) and the Terms file (<a href="TERMS-E.htm">TERMS.E</a>) should be done as new items are required or changes need to be made.<br><br>Items should be added and updated as required to the serial master file as required using <a href="SERIAL-E.htm">SERIAL.E</a>.<br><br>At some point in time it may be appropriate purge some of the older service orders the system.  This is done with the purge procedure provided in the batch processes menu.<br></P>
