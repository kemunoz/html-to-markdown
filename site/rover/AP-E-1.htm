<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>AP Id</b></TD><TD width="490">If you wish to access an A/P record which already exists, enter that number.  If you wish to enter  a new A/P record, you may either enter a new ID now, or leave this field null to assign a new A/P ID when the record is filed.  Additionally, if you know the PO number, but do not know the AP id of the record you wish to update, an option is provided in the help menu which allows you to enter a PO number and a list of all AP items with that PO number assigned.  <br><br><br>When creating a new AP record do not include a dash in the AP ID.  Only records created through a purchase order receipt can contain a dash.  If you enter an AP ID that you believe was created from a purchase order receipt and you receive an error message, verify that the receipt was posted.  Until a receipt is posted, the AP ID cannot be accessed in this procedure.  If the receipt was posted, it is possible that the AP ID was deleted in AP.E and no longer exists.  You should be able to verify this by running a report called <a href="APREG-R2.htm">APREG.R2</a> which will list all APREG entries for a given record id.	If the AP ID was deleted it cannot be re-used in AP.E.<br><br>There is a load option available from this field to create an invoice/debit memo from an MSHIP record.  MSHIP records are created via <a href="MSHIP-E.htm">MSHIP.E</a> (miscellaneous shipment entry screen) and are generated to return material to a vendor.  The vendor information and line item information will be loaded into this screen. However, the unit prices are not entered in <a href="MSHIP-E.htm">MSHIP.E</a> and will, therefore, need to be entered in this procedure along with the g/l account numbers.<br></TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Batch Number</b></TD><TD width="490">If you wish to keep track of all AP items entered for a 'batch', enter the batch number to use here. This number will be defaulted into subsequent AP items until you quit from the AP.E procedure.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Invoice#</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the number of the invoice received from the vendor.  If this number is not present, the record is treated as an accrual for goods or services received which have not yet been invoiced.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Inv Date</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the date which appears on the vendor's  invoice.  This date is important when calculating discounts.

<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Register Date</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the date that should be posted to the a/p register records and ultimately the general ledger.  If the 'default register date to invoice date' option is selected in the <a href="AP-CONTROL.htm">AP.CONTROL</a> procedure, the invoice-date will be loaded into this field for you.  If that option is not selected, the current date will loaded into this field for you.  <br><br>If this date is changed on an existing record, the date on the existing APREG records will not be changed.  Use <a href="AP-E2.htm">AP.E2</a> to change the existing register dates for this invoice.  This date will be posted to new APREG records that are created to reflect an amount or account number change. <br></TD>

You cannot change the status on a record in a "P" or "C" status.   To re-open an invoice, you need to change the invoice and misc/distribution amounts.

When the record is saved, you will be asked to confirm that the open amount on the invoice should be cancelled (i.e. set to zero).  If you select this option, all amounts on the invoice will be set to zero and register records will be created in the APREG file to back the money out of the accounts they were posted to.
