<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Make/Buy</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the letter "M" if the part number defines an item which is made in-house.  Enter "B" if it is purchased from an outside source.  If the part is sometimes made in house and sometimes purchased, or it is purchased but you supply the parts then enter "C" (combination).	This code is used by MRP to determine if demand for lower level components is to be generated.	Requirements for all parts on an assembly unless the Make/Buy code is set to B. In this case MRP will not create demand for the components even if there is a bill of material on file.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Min/Max</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter "Y" if this part is to be included in the Minimum/Maximum inventory calculation process.<br></TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Pegging</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the letter "Y" if requirements pegging is to be maintained by MRP for the part number. Enter "N" if pegging should not be maintained. As a general rule, those parts which are common to almost all assemblies and/or are not of significant value should be set to "N" since knowing the specific source of demand for the item is not very useful.  These types of parts also tend to slow down the MRP processing.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Order Policy</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the order policy to be used for the part. The options are...<br>	D - Discrete.<br>		Planned orders are generated to match the<br>		actual quantity required; no more, no less.<br>   F - Fixed.<br>       Planned orders are created based on the<br>       quantity required, and then modified by<br>       the order modifiers Minimum Order Quantity<br>		and Order Multiple.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Order Minimum</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the the minimum order quantity to be used when ordering this part. You may also enter the letter "U" followed by a number which specifies that the average monthly usage should be used as the order minimum. The number entered after the "U" indicates the number to multiply the monthly usage number by to obtain the order minimum. Fractions may be entered to specify portions of monthly usage (e.g. .5 would be 1/2 month usage). MRP uses the order minimum to round up the demand for a part so that it is no less than the order minimum.  For example, if the order minimum was set to 100 and MRP found demand for 77, a planned order would be created for 100.  If the demand was for 110 the planned order would be for 110 since it already exceeded the minumum.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Order Multiple</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the order multiple to be used when ordering this part. You may also enter the letter "U" followed by a number which specifies that the average monthly usage should be used as the order multiple. The number entered after the "U" indicates the number to multiply the monthly usage number by to obtain the order multiple. Fractions may be entered to designate a portion of the monthly usage (e.g. .5 would be 1/2 month). The order multiple is used by MRP to round up planned order quantities to the next multiple. For example, if the order multiple was set to 50 and MRP found demand for 65 the planned order quantity would be rounded up to 100.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Order Maximum</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the the maximum order quantity to be used when ordering this part. You may also enter the letter "U" followed by a number which specifies that the average monthly usage should be used as the order maximum. The number entered after the "U" indicates the number to multiply the monthly usage number by to obtain the maximum quantity. Fractions may be entered to designate a portion of the monthly usage (e.g. .5 would be 1/2 month). The maximum quantity serves as a control valve on planned orders by causing an exception message to be generated when a planned order exceeds the maximum.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Mrp Decimals</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the number of decimal places that will be used by MRP for requirements and planned order calculations.  This will only need to be set if the part has bill of material quantities in small fractions that result in gross requirements of less than 1.  Leave blank to default MRP calculations in whole numbers (normal processing).	Valid values are 0 through 4.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Safety Stock</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the amount of inventory that should be considered safety stock. You may also enter the letter "U" followed by a number to specify that the safety stock should be based on the average monthly usage. The number following the "U" may be a fraction and specifies the number of months of usage (or partial month) to use.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Maximum Stock</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the maximum amount of inventory which should be maintained for this part number. This number is used in the MRP calculation and will cause an exception message to be generated if the projected balance within the MRP horizon exceeds the maximum defined in this field.  You may also enter the letter "U" followed by a number to indicate that the average monthly usage multiplied by the number should be used as the maximum stock number.  You may also enter a fractional quantity to designate a partial month.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Scrap Factor</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the scrap factor to be used for the part in MRP processing.  The scrap factor should be entered as a percentage (up to 2 decimals allowed) of the parts which you anticipate will be scrapped.	For example, if you determined that 2 and 1/2% of the items will be scrapped then enter 2.5.  The net effect of the scrap factor is to increase the demand for the item enough to offset the effect of scrap.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Lead Time</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the number of work days lead time normally associated with this part or enter the letter "D" to indicate that the lead time is to be calculated dynamically based on the routing and planned order quantity in MRP and MPS.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Time Phased OP</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the time phased order point quantity for this part if applicable.	The period covered by the quantity entered is 30 days.	You may also  choose to enter the letter "U" which will cause the calculation to use the historical average usage as the quantity.	Leave this field blank if no time phased order point is desired.  The net affect of placing a quantity into this field is that demand in MRP will be calculated as the greater of actual demand or the quantity entered.<br></TD>
