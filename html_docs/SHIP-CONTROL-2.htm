<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Carrier</b></TD><TD width="490">Select the freight companies you wish to interface with M3. Services available include shipping rate lookups, address verification and an interface to the carriers shipping terminal software.  In order to begin using the interface with the carriers shipping terminal an on site visit will be required by a representative of the carrier.  <br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Export Path</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the export path to be used when sending data to the freight carrier.  Please note that the shipping data that will be exported will be saved in a text file that can than be loaded into the freight carrier's software.  <br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Export Id</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the name of the export (i.e. record) id that data will be written to.  This text file will then be read by the freight carrier and imported into their system.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Default Country Code</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the 2 digit carrier code for the country which should be used as the default country code.  A country code must be passed to the carrier as part of the export process.	Therefore, if no country has been entered on the sales order or shipper, the system will use the country code listed here.	If no country code is entered here,  "US" (for United States) will be used. by the export process.	The country can be changed directly in the freight carrier's software.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Package Type</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the default package type that should be sent to the freight carrier.  This is a required field in the export process for FEDEX.  Therefore, if no entry has been made here, the system will export a package type of "Customer Packaging" to the Fedex Worldship System.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>On Line Export</b></TD><TD width="490">Check this box if you wish to update the export file when a shipper is created/updated via <a href="SHIP-E2.htm">SHIP.E2</a>. or <a href="SHIP-E4.htm">SHIP.E4</a>.  If you have selected the option to have the system auto create the import ids, the text file will, also, be updated via <a href="SO-E.htm">SO.E</a>. The export file is the text file that the freight carrier uses to import data into their system.	This box does not need to be checked if you will only be processing shipments once a day at a set time.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Export from So?</b></TD><TD width="490">Check this box, if you wish to auto create export ids based on the sales order record. If this box is checked, a dummy ship id will be created and posted to the export file that is read by the freight carrier (e.g. UPS or FEDX) and imported into their system.	This dummy ship id will be the next available shipper for the sales order.	For example, if you create a new sales order,  the dummy ship id will be the sales order number plus a -1.	If however, you have a sales order for which three shippers have already been created, the dummy ship id will be the sales order plus a -4.  The users can then import the data into the freight carrier's software by referencing this ship id. This allows the user to import the data without first having to create the shipper and access <a href="SHIP-E2.htm">SHIP.E2</a>.  The system will auto create these ids for you from the sales order and shipper entry procedures.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Include Company Code</b></TD><TD width="490">Check this box, if you wish to include the company code in the data being exported to the freight carrier.

The value of the shipment is the total of all line items being shipped.  It does not include such charges as tax, freight and misc. charges that have been added to the shipper.	You might want to export this field if an insurance/value surcharge will be included in the shipping cost.<br></TD>
</TR>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Include Invoice Amt</b></TD><TD width="490">Check this box if you wish to export the total invoice amount to the freight carrier.  This amount will include the sales amount plus tax plus any freight and miscellaneous charges that have been applied to the shipper.	This amount does not include credit memos that may have been applied to the sales order.  Any changes to the freight, handling charges, etc. that have been made in the freight carrier's software will not be reflected in this amount.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>

Regardless of when data is exported into M3 from the freight carrier, <a href="SHIP-P4.htm">SHIP.P4</a> should be scheduled to run at least once a day.  This will ensure that all packaging information has been loaded into M3 for a given day.  If you have checked this option, the possibility exists that some of the shipment data may not be correct if the waybill/tracking number has been voided but the shipment in M3 has not been updated.	For example, if you shipped a package at 10:00 am and voided it at 2:00 p.m., the waybill will show as valid in the SHIP and SO records until the shipment data is reloaded into M3.  Please note, that if shipping via FEDEX, voided tags are not updated/removed from the SHIP record until <a href="SHIP-P4.htm">SHIP.P4</a> has been processed.<br></TD>

The freight amount on the header tab of <a href="ship-e2.htm">ship.e2</a> is the freight amount charged to the customer.<br></TD>

This is accomplished opening the web site with the appropriate site address information and, optionally, imbedding the tracking number in the address string.  Since each carrier uses a different syntax for their web addresses you must specify the address for each in this field.	You can make this a simple address that gets the user to the web site, such as www.ups.com, or a more complex address that includes the tracking number so the user doesn't have to enter the number into the web site by hand.  Since the tracking number is variable it needs to be specified within the address with the text ~tracknumber~.  The address may also require a country specification which you must identify as ~country~.<br><br>The string for the UPS web site would be defined as http://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/processInputRequest?HTMLVersion=5.0&loc=en_~country~&Requester=UPSHome&tracknum=~tracknumber~&AgreeToTermsAndConditions=y<br>es&track.x=13&track.y=9<br><br>The FEDEX web site would be defined as<br>http://www.fedex.com/Tracking?ascend_header=1&clienttype=dotcom&cntry_code=~country~&language=english&tracknumbers=~tracknumber~%0D%<br></TD>
