</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Description</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter a description of the work center being defined and any standard instructions.<br></TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Fixed Overhead Percent</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the percentage to be used for calculating fixed overhead for the work center.

<TD valign="top" width="155"><b>Capacity Date</b></TD><TD width="490">Enter the date on which the associated capacity hours become effective.	You may enter multiple date and hour combinations to specify what the daily capacity of the work center will be for a period of time.  The hours entered are used as the work center capacity until the next date. Note: If you are using Capacity Requirements Planning (i.e. CRP), a date and hours entry is required for the work center capacity to be included in CRP. If you decide to change any of the dates and associated hours, you must run the <a href="CRP-P1.htm">CRP.P1</a> process to reset the capacity files.<br></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
