If you are creating a new shipment you should leave this prompt blank.  If you want to make a change to an existing shipment you should enter the full shipment record ID.  The ID of a shipment record is made up of the sales order number followed by a sequential number maintained for each sales order. For example, the first shipment for sales order 123 would be 123-1, the second 123-2 etc.<br></TD>

The "N" status sets the shipment as a new shipment just as the <a href="SHIP-E.htm">SHIP.E</a> procedure does, and does not create any inventory transactions.  The "S" status will confirm the shipment by creating inventory transactions, and will be posted the next time the procedure <a href="SHIP-P1.htm">SHIP.P1</a> is run.
